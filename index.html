      The primary reference book for these meetings is
      <em>Introduction to Analytic Number Theory</em> written by Tom
      M. Apostol. Admittedly, the book is quite expensive but you may
      find a relatively cheap paperback (softcover) copy on some
      websites.
    </p>
    <p>
      These meetings are hosted
      by <a href="https://github.com/susam">Susam</a> from
      the <a href="https://web.libera.chat/#algorithms">#algorithms</a>
      channel of Libera IRC network. These meetings are attended by
      some members of this channel, other related channels, as well as
      by some members
      from <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      You are welcome to join our meetings anytime. If you are
      concerned that the meetings may not make sense if you join when
      we are in the middle of a chapter, please free to talk to us
      about it in <a href="../#join">our channel</a>. We can recommend
      the next best time to begin joining our meetings. Usually, it
      would be when we begin reading a new section or chapter that is
      fairly self-contained and does not depend a lot on material we
      have read previously.
