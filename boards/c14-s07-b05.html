# Finding minimum for $ f(t) $ in the Note After Theorem 14.5

We know that
$$
f(t) = \frac{\pi^2}{6t} + nt + \log t.
$$


## First Derivative Test

Now we solve $ f'(t) = 0 $ as follows:
$$
- \frac{\pi^2}{6t^2} + n + \frac{1}{t} = 0.
$$

Multiplying both sides by $ t^2 $ we get,
$$
nt^2 + t - \frac{\pi^2}{6} = 0.
$$

Solving this quadratic equation and considering that $ t_0 > 0 $ we get
the solution
$$
t
= \frac{-1 + \sqrt{1 + 4n\pi^2/6}}{2n}
= \frac{-1 + \sqrt{1 + 2n\pi^2/3}}{2n}.
$$


## Second Derivative Test

We now find $ f''(t) $ as follows:
$$
f''(t)
= \frac{2\pi^2}{6t^3} - \frac{1}{t^2}
= \frac{1}{t^2} \left( \frac{\pi^2}{3t} - 1 \right).
$$

From the first derivative test we know that our solution $ t_0 $
satisfies
$$
nt_0^2 + t_0 = \frac{\pi^2}{6}.
$$

Thus
$$
t_0 < \frac{\pi^2}{6} < \frac{\pi^2}{3}.
$$

Since $ t_0 > 0 $, from the above inequality we get,
$$
\frac{\pi^2}{3t_0} > 1.
$$

Thus
$$
\frac{1}{t_0} \left( \frac{\pi^2}{3t_0} - 1 \right) > 0.
$$


## Conclusion

We have shown that
\begin{align*}
f'(t_0) &= 0, \\
f''(t_0) &> 0,
\end{align*}
so $ t_0 $ is the minimum for $ f(t) $.
